# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 
My name is Vicente (@Vichoriz0) and I'm a software developer currently residing in Chile. My prononouns are he/him.

I have recently graduated from Universidad AndrÃ©s Bello (in Chile as well) as a computer engineer, and I don't much experience just yet, but I'm working to expand my knowledge and abilities and hopefully find a way to help with the challenges we are facing today as a society (mainly climate change).

Currently, I'm learning ReactJS and different platforms to host applications, like Firebase, Vercel, Heroku and Netifly. So far it's been a fun ride.
